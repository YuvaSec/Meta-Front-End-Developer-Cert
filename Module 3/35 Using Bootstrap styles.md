Using Modifiers
- Modifiers in Bootstrap allow for easy customization of components, such as alerts, by changing colors (e.g., "alert-primary" for blue, "alert-danger" for red).
- Alerts are useful for conveying important information, warnings, or errors to users, with different colors indicating different types of messages.
