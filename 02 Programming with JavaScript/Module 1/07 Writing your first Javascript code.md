## The semi-colon in JavaScript

In the English language, the fullstop or period - the . character - is used to separate thoughts into sentences.
By clearly separating thoughts with the fullstop, you avoid being misunderstood.

In JavaScript, the semi-colon - the ; character - has a similar purpose: it is used to clearly delimit parts of the code from some other parts of the code.


### Automatic Semi-Colon Insertion (ASI)

Interestingly, the browser has a feature known as "Automatic Semi-colon Insertion"
	it does a pretty good job of "filling in the blanks" in case there is a missing semi-colon where there should be one.
