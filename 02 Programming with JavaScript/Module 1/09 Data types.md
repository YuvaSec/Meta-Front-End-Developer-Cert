# **Understanding Primitive Data Types**

- JavaScript has 
	- # seven primitive data types: 
	- string,  
	- number, 
	- Boolean, 
	- null, 
	- undefined, 
	- BigInt, 
	- symbol.

# **Key Characteristics of Data Types**

- ***Strings must be enclosed in quotes***, 
	- while numbers are entered as numerical values.
- *The number data type has a **limited range**, while strings can have an almost infinite number of combinations.*

# **Additional Data Types**

- The Boolean data type has two values: **true** and **false.**
- ==Null== represents the absence of a value, 
	- while ==undefined indicates== a variable that has not been assigned a value.
- ===BigInt=== allows for larger numbers, and symbols serve as unique identifiers to avoid conflicts.
