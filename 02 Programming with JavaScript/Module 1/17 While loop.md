Understanding the While Loop

- The while loop is similar to the for loop but requires the counter value to be set before the loop starts.
- The exit condition is specified in the parentheses of the loop declaration, allowing JavaScript to check if the condition is true to execute the loop.

Constructing a While Loop

- A variable called "counter" is initialized (e.g., set to 3), and the condition checks if the counter is greater than 0.
```js

let counter = 3;

while(counter>0){
	console.log(counter);
	counter--;
}
```



- Inside the loop, the current value of the counter is logged to the console, and the counter is decremented by 1 after each iteration.

Loop Execution Process

- The loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true, logging the counter values (3, 2, 1) until the counter reaches 0.
- Once the condition is false, any code following the loop will execute, such as logging "Happy New Year" to the console.


## **Task 3**
```js
console.log(1)

console.log(2)

console.log(3)

console.log(4)

console.log(5)

console.log('Counting completed!')
```

## **Task 4**
```js
console.log(5)

console.log(4)

console.log(3)

console.log(2)

console.log(1)

console.log('Countdown finished!')
```

## **Task 5**
```js
console.log(2018)

console.log(2019)

console.log(2020)

console.log(2021)

console.log(2022)
```
