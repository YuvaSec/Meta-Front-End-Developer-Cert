# Understanding Boolean Data Type
- The Boolean data type has only two possible values: ==true== and ==false.==
- It is used to check the results of comparisons, 
	- such as whether one number is less than or greater than another.
	- 1 < 2 True;
	- 1 > 2 False;

## Comparison Operators
- JavaScript uses various operators for comparisons, including 
	- ==' equality '==
	- ==' strict equality '==
- The equality operator checks only for value, while the strict equality operator checks both value and type.

	- ==equality (= =)==
		- 1 == 2 False;
		- 1 == "1" True;
	- ==strict equality (= = =)==
		- 1 === "1" False;

# Inequality Operators
- The inequality operator (≠) checks if two values are not equal,
	- while the strict inequality operator (! = =) 
checks for both value and type differences.
