- Before coding, it's crucial to determine how to represent data, such as using strings, variables, or arrays.
- Arrays are highlighted as an efficient way to group related data, making it easier to perform calculations like finding an average.![[Screenshot 2025-11-30 at 18.50.56.png]]





# Common JavaScript Data Structures
- Objects: Collections of key-value pairs, useful for storing and accessing values by keys.

Maps and Sets

- Maps: Similar to arrays but consist of key-value pairs where any value can be a key, unlike objects which are limited to strings or symbols.
