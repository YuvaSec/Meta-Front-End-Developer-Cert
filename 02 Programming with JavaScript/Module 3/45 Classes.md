# Understanding Classes

- Classes serve as blueprints for creating multiple objects with 
	- ***Specific properties and methods***.
- In JavaScript, a class is defined using 
	- ==`class`== keyword, 
	- ==`class name`== and 
	- ==`constructor function within curly braces`==.

The constructor function initializes object properties using *==`parameters`==* passed during instantiation.

- Methods can be added to the class 
	- ==`without using the `**function**` keyword`==, allowing for direct invocation on object instances.

- Once a class is defined, you can create instances (objects) of that class and access their methods and properties.
