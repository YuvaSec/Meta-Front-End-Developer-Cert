# Understanding IP Addresses

- IP addresses function like postal addresses, allowing data packets to be delivered to the correct destination.
- There are two main versions of IP addresses: IPv4 (e.g., 192.0.2.235) and IPv6 (e.g., 4527:0a00:1567:0200:ff00:0042:8329).

# Structure of IP Packets

- IP packets consist of a header (containing destination and source IP addresses) and a payload (the actual data).
- The header includes additional information to assist in delivering the packet, similar to how a return address is included in a letter.

# Protocols for Data Transmission

- Common protocols like
	- [[Whats a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)?|TCP]] (Transmission Control Protocol) and 
	- [[What is a UDP (User Datagram Protocol)?|UDP]] (User Datagram Protocol) 
	- help manage data transmission.
- TCP ensures data arrives correctly and in order, while UDP allows for some data loss, suitable for applications like voice calls or live streaming.
