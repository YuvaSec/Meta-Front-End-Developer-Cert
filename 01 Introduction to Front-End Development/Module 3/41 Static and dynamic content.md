- Static content consists of files that are sent to the browser exactly as they are stored on the server, such as images and videos.
- Dynamic content is generated in real-time based on user input or other variables, often requiring more processing time.

- A web server delivers static content directly to the browser, while an application server generates dynamic content by processing requests and interacting with databases.
- Application servers handle complex tasks, such as running application logic and checking user permissions.

# **Caching for Performance**![[Chacheing in webserver.mp4]]
- To improve performance, web servers use caching to store copies of dynamic content, allowing them to quickly serve cached versions for repeated requests.
- This reduces the load on application servers and speeds up content delivery to users.
