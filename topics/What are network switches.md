# Very Important Points:

- Network switches connect multiple wired devices within a local area network (LAN) and forward data packets to destination devices based on their MAC addresses.
    
- Operate at Layer 2 (data link layer) of the [[what is an OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model?|OSI]] model; Layer 3 switches also operate at Layer 3 (network layer) and support routing between IP subnets.
    
- Layer 2 switches forward frames using MAC addresses within the same VLAN or subnet; Layer 3 switches route packets between different VLANs or subnets using IP addresses.

- Key function of Layer 3 switches includes inter-VLAN routing, allowing communication between separate network segments.

- Layer 2 switches create separate collision domains per port to reduce data collisions; Layer 3 switches manage multiple broadcast domains.
    
- Modern switches support VLANs for traffic segmentation, security, and network management flexibility.
    
- Layer 3 switches can handle static and dynamic routing protocols, reducing latency and improving throughput by routing in hardware.
    
- Switches support full-duplex communication, enabling simultaneous sending and receiving of data, enhancing network performance.
    
- Managed switches offer advanced features like traffic monitoring, Quality of Service (QoS), and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent loops.
    

# Important Points:

- Switches reduce unnecessary network traffic by sending data only to the intended destination port.
    
- Layer 3 switches combine switching and routing functionalities in one device.
    
- Layer 2 switches are ideal for simple LAN setups, whereas Layer 3 switches suit larger, segmented networks.
    
- Switches use MAC address tables to map device addresses to physical ports for efficient packet forwarding.
    
- Full-duplex and collision management mechanisms in switches improve overall network efficiency.
    
- Advanced switches often support security features like 802.1X authentication and MAC address filtering.
    
- Hardware design of switches includes components like CPU, memory, switching engine, and multiple ports for connectivity.
    
- Selecting switches with scalability and modularity allows future network expansion and performance optimization.
