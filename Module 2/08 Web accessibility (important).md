# Understanding Web Accessibility

- Web accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of disability, can access and interact with websites.
- It encompasses various disabilities, including visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical impairments.

# Assistive Technologies

- Users with disabilities often rely on assistive technologies like screen readers and speech recognition software to navigate the web.
- These tools help make content more accessible, such as providing subtitles for videos.

# Best Practices for Accessibility

- Incorporating accessibility from the beginning of a project is crucial; retrofitting can be challenging.
- Proper HTML structure and the use of appropriate elements enhance accessibility for assistive technologies.
