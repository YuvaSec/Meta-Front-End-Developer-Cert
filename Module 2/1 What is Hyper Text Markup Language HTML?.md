# Understanding HTML

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundational structure of web pages, consisting of 
	- Elements
	- Tags.
- Each HTML document is a text file with a specific structure, typically ending with a .html suffix.

HTML Tags and Elements

- HTML elements are created using opening and closing tags, such as `<p>` for paragraphs, which can contain text and other elements.
- Some elements are **self-closing** , like the line break tag `<br>`, which does not require a closing tag.

HTML Standards

- The rules for HTML elements and tags are defined by the HTML specification, maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
- The current version of HTML is HTML5, which standardizes how web pages are structured and displayed by browsers.
