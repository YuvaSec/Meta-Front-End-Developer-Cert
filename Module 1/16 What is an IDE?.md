# IDE Overview

- An IDE is software designed for building applications, functioning similarly to a text editor but specifically for writing code.
- IDEs can be language-specific or support multiple programming languages.

Key Features of IDEs

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhances code readability by coloring keywords differently, making it easier to identify them.
- **Error Highlighting**: Identifies mistakes in code, similar to spell check in text documents, helping developers catch errors quickly.

Advanced Functionalities

- **Autocomplete**: Suggests code completions as you type, improving coding efficiency.
- **Refactoring**: Allows developers to change code structure (like renaming functions) across multiple files automatically, reducing errors and saving time.

Overall, IDEs are essential tools that enhance the coding experience and improve productivity for developers.
