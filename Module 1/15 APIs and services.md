# Types of APIs

- **Browser APIs**: Built into browsers, these APIs enhance functionality and simplify complex tasks. Examples include the DOM API for manipulating HTML documents and the Geolocation API for retrieving location data.

- **REST APIs**: These APIs follow the principles of Representational State Transfer, allowing efficient data exchange between clients and servers. They handle operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

- **Sensor-Based APIs**: These APIs connect physical sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling communication and data tracking among devices, such as smart lights.

API Functionality

- APIs serve as bridges between different systems, facilitating data transfer and interaction.
- They utilize endpoints in URLs to access resources and perform server-side processing to generate responses, typically in the form of web pages or JSON data.

Overall, understanding and working with various types of APIs is crucial for web developers to enhance system capabilities and create seamless user experiences.
