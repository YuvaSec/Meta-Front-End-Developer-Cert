HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Interaction

- HTML is used to structure the content of a web page, such as a digital clock or a video player.
- CSS styles the HTML elements, controlling their appearance, including position, size, and color.

Creating a Digital Clock Example

- The HTML file defines the clock's structure, while the CSS file styles it for visual appeal.
- JavaScript updates the clock every second, demonstrating dynamic content updates.

Building an Interactive Video Player

- The HTML file includes a video element and a play button, with CSS applied for styling.
- JavaScript manages the play/pause functionality of the video, changing the button icon based on the video's state.
