- A web browser is like a window that lets you explore the vast world of the internet. 
- When you want to visit a website, 
	- you type its address, known as a [[Whats a URL?|URL]], into the browser. 
	- The browser then sends a request to a special computer called a [[05 What is a web server and how does it work?|web server]].

	- And this is back and froth communication is called [[What is a Request Response Cycle| request response cycle]]

- Imagine you’re at a restaurant. 
	- You tell the waiter (the browser) what you want to eat (the URL), and the waiter goes to the kitchen (the web server) to place your order. 
	- The kitchen prepares your meal (the website) and sends it back to the waiter, who then serves it to you. 
	- This back-and-forth communication is what makes browsing the internet possible!
